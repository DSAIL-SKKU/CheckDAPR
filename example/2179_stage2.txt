Based on the analysis and the guidelines provided, here's the calculation of the DAPR score:

Stress Score:
S1: 0 (Rain is present)
S2: 1 (Rain is present)
S3: 0 (Rain doesn't appear to occupy more space than the person)
S4: 0 (Rain is depicted as dots)
S6: 1 (Rain appears to be in contact with the person)
S8: 0 (No wind is evident)
S9: 0 (No puddles)
S10: 0 (No puddles)
S11: 0 (Rain is only dots)
S13: 0 (No lightning)
S14: 0 (No lightning strikes)
S15: 0 (No clouds)
S16: 0 (No dark clouds)

Stress score: 0+1+0+0+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 2

Resource Score:
R1: 0 (No protection present)
R2: 0 (No umbrella)
R3: 0 (No umbrella held)
R5: 0 (No protection)
R6: 0 (No protection)
R11: 0 (Face is a simple circle, not detailed)
R12: 0 (No smile or expression visible)
R13: 1 (Figure appears centered)
R14: 1 (Assuming the figure is between 2-6 inches, as it's a typical sketch size)
R15: 0 (Depicted as a stick figure)

Resource score: 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1+1+0 = 2

Total DAPR Score: Resource Score - Stress Score = 2 - 2 = 0

Output format:
- Stress score: 2
- Resource score: 2
- Total Score: 0
