Based on the analysis of the sketch and object detection results, here's the calculation of the DAPR score:

Stress Score:
S1: 0 (Rain is present)
S2: 1 (Rain is present)
S3: 1 (Rain appears to occupy a significant portion of the image)
S4: 1 (Rain is depicted as teardrops)
S6: 1 (Rain appears to be touching the figure)
S8: 0 (No wind is apparent)
S9: 1 (One puddle is present)
S10: 0 (The figure is not standing in the puddle)
S11: 0 (Rain is only depicted in one style)
S13: 0 (No lightning)
S14: 0 (No lightning strikes)
S15: 2 (Two cloud-like shapes are present)
S16: 0 (Clouds are not specifically described as dark)

Stress score: 0+1+1+1+1+0+1+0+0+0+0+2+0 = 7

Resource Score:
R1: 0 (No protective measures against rain)
R2: 0 (No umbrella)
R3: 0 (No umbrella held)
R5: 0 (No protection present)
R6: 0 (No protection present)
R11: 1 (The full face appears to be visible)
R12: 1 (The figure appears to be smiling)
R13: 1 (The figure is centered in the image)
R14: 1 (Assuming the figure is of appropriate size, though this cannot be definitively determined from the information given)
R15: 1 (The figure appears to be depicted from head to toe facing forward)

Resource score: 0+0+0+0+0+1+1+1+1+1 = 5

DAPR Score Calculation:
Total Score: Resource Score - Stress Score = 5 - 7 = -2

- Stress score: 7
- Resource score: 5
- Total Score: -2
