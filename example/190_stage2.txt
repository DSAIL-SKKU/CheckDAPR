Based on the analysis provided, I'll calculate the DAPR score as requested:

Stress Score:
S1: 0 (rain is present)
S2: 1 (rain is present)
S3: 1 (rain appears to occupy a large portion of the image)
S4: 1 (rain is depicted as lines)
S6: 1 (rain appears to be in contact with the person)
S8: 0 (no wind is evident)
S9: 0 (no puddles mentioned)
S10: 0 (no puddles mentioned)
S11: 0 (rain is only depicted as lines)
S13: 0 (no lightning present)
S14: 0 (no lightning present)
S15: 3 (three clouds are present)
S16: 0 (no mention of dark clouds)

Resource Score:
R1: 1 (protection present - raincoat mentioned)
R2: 1 (umbrella present)
R3: 0 (umbrella not held, lying on the ground)
R5: 0 (no information about size of protection)
R6: 1 (no mention of damaged protection)
R11: 1 (face appears to be visible)
R12: 0 (no mention of smile or expression)
R13: 1 (figure described as in the center)
R14: 0 (no information about size of figure)
R15: 0 (described as a stick figure)

Calculation:
- Stress score: 0+1+1+1+1+0+0+0+0+0+0+3+0 = 7
- Resource score: 1+1+0+0+1+1+0+1+0+0 = 5
- Total Score: 5 - 7 = -2
