Based on the analysis provided, I'll calculate the DAPR score as requested:

Stress Score:
S1: 0 (Rain is present)
S2: 1 (Rain is present)
S3: 0 (No indication of excess rain)
S4: 1 (Rain depicted as lines)
S6: 1 (Rain appears to be in contact with the person)
S8: 0 (No indication of wind)
S9: 2 (Two puddles present)
S10: 0 (Not standing in puddles)
S11: 0 (Only one style of rain depicted)
S13: 0 (No lightning)
S14: 0 (No lightning strikes)
S15: 0 (No clouds)
S16: 0 (No dark clouds)

Resource Score:
R1: 1 (Protection present - raincoat)
R2: 0 (No umbrella)
R3: 0 (No umbrella to hold)
R5: 1 (Raincoat appears adequately sized)
R6: 1 (Protection appears intact)
R11: 1 (Whole face visible)
R12: 1 (Person appears to be smiling)
R13: 1 (Figure seems centered)
R14: 1 (Assuming the figure is within 2-6 inches, as this can't be determined from the image alone)
R15: 1 (Whole figure depicted from head to toe, facing forward)

Calculation:
- Stress score: 0+1+0+1+1+0+2+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 5
- Resource score: 1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 8
- Total Score: 8 - 5 = 3
